# App providers (`src/app/providers`)

Use this folder for application-wide provider composition.

Examples (to be added later):
- React Query client provider wrappers.
- Router-level provider composition.
- Theme providers, i18n providers, etc.

Keep providers small and focused; avoid putting business logic here.
